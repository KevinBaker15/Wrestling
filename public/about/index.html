    </header>
    <p>This website is dedicated to providing the latest college wrestling rankings for the 2025-26 season. 
    The rankings are based on a combination of last season's performance, projected performance, and my opinion.</p>
    <h2 class="aboutH2">About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Kevin Baker, and I am a wrestling fan with a passion for following the sport.
    I created this website to practice my coding skills and share my insights and rankings with 
    fellow wrestling fans.</p>
    <!-- I want to mention something about how I coded this with the help of friends -->
